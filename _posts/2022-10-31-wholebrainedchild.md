title: The Whole Brained Child- Book review
comments: true
---

I often stare at my baby boy and wish I could know what he is thinking. Yesterday he had a drum in both hands and kept putting on his back then lifting it over his head; for fifteen minutes! He thought it was the funniest thing and my wife and I cheered him on, but between you and me; I didn't get the joke. I think many parents want to know what is going on in their kids _wet computer_. That's why one of the bestselling books on teaching kids is by a baby _mush palace_ scientist, Daniel J. Siegel, a neuropsychiatrist. 

# top 5 things you MUST know about this book

As far as content goes, I feel like I have developed an opinionated hierarchy of quality. From my favorite to my least favorite: 
- Expert in field doing meta-analysis of topic
- Expert in field sharing experience
- expert in semi-related field making comparisons/parallel thoughts
- Expert in unrelated field using analogies
-  person with experience sharing experience
- listicle of things with NO Explanation 

# Expert in unrelated field using analogies

I think this book falls under the category of "Expert in unrelated field using analogies". But wants you to think it is a "expert in semi-related field making comparisons/parallel thoughts". 

I think one way to write a book like this would be to search through what we know about a child’s learning _sponge calculator_. Find research on what works for teaching, and present that. How I think they made this book is they asked, what are the best practices when teaching kids, okay how can we try to explain this using Neuroscience. I'm not arguing this is bad. I just think the neuroscience was added post-hoc.

I will justify my above reasoning but know that I am not a Neuroscientist. I think that we don't have a full model of how a child brain learns. But somehow this book presents a complete model of how to teach kids. It explains far more than neuroscience claims to know. The book can get away with saying that it is "Science backed" and "research based" because ethe neuroscience is all that. But no study shows a link that "You must synchronize the upstairs and downstairs brain to fully understand", which is a chapter in this book. Therefore this isn't a book about what neuroscience knows about child _squishy control centers_ its a book about teaching children and the parallels that exist in neuroscience.

## My example
For example, I'm a chemist, sometimes. I could write a book called "the CHEMISTRY of child learning". 
Chapter 1: controlling for the environment 
Think of a boiling pot of water. At either point you can look at the pot and say, its boiling or it's not boiling. In reality, it is a complex system of atoms that just barely know about each other's presence. Changing a single atom from liquid to gas will not make a pot boil. You need to change the entire environment so that a bunch of individuals, barely connected atoms change their state.
In the same way we cannot teach our child facts on index cards and expect them to know a topic. Just as you can't "boil" one atom and call the pot boiling. We must create an environment in which the child is willing to learn lots of facts repetitively. Having a child memorize that a T-Rex was the apex predator is trying to boil a single atom. Taking a child to a museum where they can touch a fossil is the flame upon which your child’s interest will  come to a boil.

See what I did there. In the Venn diagram of chemistry and child learning there is no shared space here. I am creating an analogy to relate two ideas that honestly should not be related. It's obvious because I make no claim that I am unearthing the chemistry of a brain. I claim the author is doing the same thing here. I am not going to belabor this point more. I admit I could be wrong on maybe 1 section, but I weakly stand by this claim. 

# summary
There are honestly PDFs that neatly summarize this book’s main points. Here is one...

I couldn't do a better job than these. 

# published in 2011
The elephant in the room. This was written just during the beginning of the replication crisis in psychology. So naturally it has a whole section on priming among other things that at the time seemed like a sound idea but now, with 2022 hindsight is very unsure. 
It's interesting that just about every old book has some dated section like this, but it will never be corrected. Seems like a problem e-books could fix in the future. 

# conclusions
In my first section of this post I list my favorite types of advice writing to the least. I end on listicles with no information, saying this is my least favorite information. _I then provided no information after; did you get my joke? Is it funnier now that I explained it?_ I have been debating whether these lists are even a net good. You have seen them everywhere. 50 things you can do to stay productive. You need to be doing these 5 things if you open a home. Are they with the read?

They might be. The first step of brainstorming is coming up with ideas, stupid and smart alike. If I am new to an idea, a low-quality list of topics in that idea range may be a good springboard. If I am new to running, a "10 things you must take with you running" list may be helpful if even 1 thing is new to me, and I later investigate it further. 
So if I think the worst type of writing (on my list) is useful, it follows that I think this writing, while in the middle of my list, is still very useful. Let me reiterate, I think this is a good book. I think the parenting techniques are useful even though I question the neuroscience basis of them. 

Getting opinions from experts in other fields is almost always a net gain. We just need to be careful to recognize that we should be taking expert opinion from child teaching experts over this book in my opinion. While they sell it as a Neuroscientist view on teaching, it is analogies from neuroscience and teaching your kids.
