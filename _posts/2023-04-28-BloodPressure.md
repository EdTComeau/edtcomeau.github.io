The red cross claims on their website that of the 75 million Americans with high blood pressure, 11 million go undiagnosed.

I have a strong personal belief that most health care workers are not properly taking a blood pressure correctly. They are guessing. There is a tradeoff between how quickly you test for blood pressure and how accurate your results are.

You can easily predict whether they are taking a proper blood pressure. I am going to outline it, but basically the faster your BP is taken, the less accurate.

# Blood Pressure background
Your blood has two pressures. When your heart is pumping (systolic) and when your heart is not pumping (diastolic). It makes sense that your blood is constantly switching between high systolic pressure every heart beat then lowering to the diastolic between beats. We report blood pressure as systolic over diastolic. 120/80 is an average blood pressure. Systolic is 120 and diastolic is 80 in this case.

# measuring it
Medical professionals use a sphinctomometer (blood pressure cuff) to apply enough pressure to stop your blood flowing to your arm. They also use a stethoscope to listen to your heart beat. 
1) cut off circulation entirely by inflating the BP cuff to around 180
2) you should hear no pulse at all
3) start deflating the cuff at a suggested 2 dial ticks per second and continue deflating it at this rate
4) when you hear a heart beat, that is your systolic BP
5) when you hear the heart beat go away, that's your diastolic

Taking a blood pressure is HARD. You are listening for a heart beat in an arm which requires silence.  As you imagine the beat doesn't just appear and disappear, it can sometimes fade in or out. 

# my issue
If you follow the suggested speed of deflation (2 ticks per second), then a full blood pressure should take 90 seconds. That is a cuff fully inflated on your arm for a minute and a half. People get pissed if you do that. 

You can shave some time off by immediately releasing the valve after you get the diastolic. You can shave off 40-ish seconds that way. Now it only takes 50 seconds. 

You can shave some time off the top of the bp if you predict someone's systolic and race to around that area. If you start at 180 and expect a systolic of 120 you can go fast up until 130. The valves on these cuffs are finicky and you definitely risk blowing the whole BP by racing like this. A lot of people do this though, it can shave off 20 seconds if your perfect, taking us to 30 seconds.

The Fastest anyone could ever take a good blood pressure is half a minute. How long does it take your practitioner to take yours? I get to see my wife's taken weekly and the average time is around 5 seconds. This is my experience as well. This is why my personal opinion is that a lot of blood pressure readings are horribly inaccurate.

# maybe this is okay?
My first thought was that maybe I am overreacting and it is possible to get a good bp quickly. Let's do some quick math.

If I take five seconds to take a BP, that dial is moving 36mmHg per second. If the average heart beat was 60 (for math simplicity) that is one beat per second. Every heart beat, the dial moves by 36!! That means the error rate is plus or minus 18 on average (36 at the worst, 0 at the best). This assumes you don't miss a single heart beat! Keep in mind the beats fade in, so they are faint at first. 

Now that is a low heart rate and I left out the part where people speed up after they found the diastolic. So it's more accurate to say that a perfect practitioner can be accurate to 10mHg on average if going at 5s. The heart beats fade in though, and no one is accurate to a single heart beat. I think once you factor in missed heart beats, this value could double. I would wager that a good practitioner might get the exactly correct heartbeat 50% of the time. With this, BP taken in 5s is accurate plus or minus 20mmHg on average, with a large distribution. 

# takeaway
I didn't get to the 20 mmHg very scientifically, it's an estimate. Being off by 20mmHg can be huge. Especially considering the doctors biases towards an average number.

My point is that you just can't take a blood pressure in 5 seconds!! This was an average for my wife, we saw half the people try quicker than that! 

# what you can do
Watch how long it takes. Know the standard by the book BP can take 30 seconds. If it is taken in an instant, I like to say "that's a lot different than what I remember my baseline being, can you try the other arm?" 
If you do this enough, you may have enough data to catch trends.
Honestly though, bad blood pressure readings seem rampant. I am not yet sure how to deal with it other than knowing it is very unreliable because of the way people take them.
