title: Book Review- How To Talk So Kids Will Listen And Listen So Kids Will Talk
---

Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish wrote the book, How To Talk So Kids Will Listen And Listen So Kids Will Talk (Which I will now affectionately call HTTSKWLaLSKWT) after learning parenting tecniques from Dr. Haim Ginott. 
This book has been around for a while and resonates with a lot of parents. 
I can see why. 

# Summary

I will try to very briefly summarize the main points in this book. I will try to reserve all my opinions and thought until after the summary.

## Helping children deal with feelings

When a child is dealing with heavy emotions, it is our job to help them safely navigate their emotional sea.

1. Listen with full attention
2. Acknowledge their feelings
3. Give their feelings a name (Sad, Mad, Happy)
4. Give them their wishes in fantasy

Completely and honestly listen and don't jump to solving the problem. Acknowledge by saying "yeah" and "ohh" to encourage them talking. Once they are completely done talking, now you can help a little bit. You can try to recognize the emotion they are feeling and name that emotion (Anger, Envy, Intimidation, etc.). Don't try to "solve" their emotions, but try to say "I wish I could squeeze my eyes close and make this all better" or something more specific. 

## Engaging Cooperation

When a child is uncooperative, these steps will help move you in the direction of resolution. 

1. Describe what you see
2. Give information
3. Say it with a word
4. Talk about your feelings
5. Write a note

Describe the problem, in a non-judgemental way. Tell the child why it is a problem. If you are getting tired of reminding, try using one word, such as "the dog" to remind your child to walk the dog. Talk about how it makes you feel. Finally you can consider putting it down in a note. A note can be taken more seriously and carries weight with it.  

## Alternatives to Punishments

Here are some alternatives to punishments. Pretty self-explainatory so no description for some. 

1. Point out a way to be helpful
2. Express strong disaproval (without attacking character)
3. State your expectations
4. Show the child how to make ammends
5. Give a choice 
6. Take action
7. Allow the child to experience the consequences of their own behavior

I don't think these merrit too much explaination. 

## Encouraging Autonomy 

How do you go about raising a child so that you guide them but allow them to flourish as their own person?

1. Let children make choices
2. Show respect for a child's struggle
3. Don't ask too many questions
4. Don't rush to answer questions
5. Encourage children to use sources outside the home
6. Don't take away hope

## Praise

When a child does something good, they deserve to be praised in the following ways:

1. Describe what you see
2. Describe what you feel
3. Sum up the child's praiseworthy behavior with a word

## Freeing Children from Playing Roles

Children can quickly fall into roles like "the problem child" or "a slow learner" and it is our job to avoid children getting these titles. 

1. Look for opportunities to show the child a new picture of themself
2. Put your child in situations where they can see themself differently
3. Let your children overhear you saying something positive about them
4. Model the behavior you would like to see
5. Be a storehouse for your kids special moments
6. When your child acts according to the old label, state your feelings and expectations

# My thoughts

This book is great for what is intended, a list of tools to have in your back pocket for parenting.

This book has been around long enough that the claim "parents find this information helpful" is verifyably true. 

I think the ideas in this book are worth talking about, but even if that weren't the case, this book presents its ideas in a very thorough and memorable way. 
Both of the authors are former teachers, and so was Dr. Haim Ginott. 
So it should come as no surprise that ideas are discussed, drawn in comics, acted out in plays, and written down in worksheets. 
I am going to attempt to summarize the ideas, but this book is basically those ideas with plenty of different ways to commit them to memory.

It brings up the question of whether an idea becomes popular because it is "Correct" or because it "feels correct".
This book has enough positive reviews from child phsycologists, I am going to assume the best case for a book written by two non-child phsycologists, which is it is a 50/50 mixture of "Correct" and "feels correct".

## On child autonomy
Some things in this book feel a bit more "free-range" (Giving children lots of autonomy/ a more hands off approach at parenting) than where I stood prior to reading this book. 
For example, if my child asks me a question about trains, this book suggests I encourage him to talk to a librarian and seek out exterior resources. 
I understand this stance. 
I understand that allowing my child to do their own research is teaching them independence in a way they could not learn if I was holding their hand through the process. 
But, I also LOVE learning and I want to show my child that. 
If my child asks about trains, even if I don't know much about trains, now I truly want to share in the fun of learning about trains. 
I hear from every parent that time flies by and I think sending my child off to the library to research trains instead of learning about trains and playing with trains with my son might be the sort of thing I regret when he is grown up.
But maybe that is selfish of me. 
Yeah, obvisouly it would be more fun to learn about trains with my son, but maybe it is STILL better to let him do that on his own.

This book was written in 1980 and I think social norms have (swung)[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2014/08/slate_childhood_survey_results_kids_today_have_a_lot_less_freedom_than_their.html] way towards helicopter parenting (Hands-On parenting/ Less autonomy for child). 
These book ideas probably make me uncomfortable because they go against current social norms. 

Here my line of questioning becomes... Is society moving from Free range children to helicopter parenting good for the children?

I often cave into social norms, I think we all do. 
Even once aware of them, it would take a really strong conviction of mine to decide to rebel and go against norms. 
I have to pick my battles.
I haven't seen enough convincing evidence to suggest 1980's social norms (more freedom/less hands-on) was healthier than todays (More hands-on/less freedom) so I will most likely be more of a helicopter parent than my parents were to me. 

> Maybe a happy medium would be relishing the closer ties between parents and children now, but also recognizing that part of being a good, caring parent is letting children discover things on their own. -(Slate)[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2014/08/slate_childhood_survey_results_kids_today_have_a_lot_less_freedom_than_their.]
