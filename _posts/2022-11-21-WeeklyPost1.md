Weekly personal journal Entry

# Saturday
We went with Sophia to Santa's village. It's cute but the dolls are a bit scary. Craig did not love Santa, he cried a bit.

We then played games with my friends. One night werewolf. It was a lot of fun! Erin Tyler Taylor and Marty came over. Craig loved seeing everyone and we had a blast.

# Sunday
We met with Mariah for breakfast at yard house. Craig did an amazing job napping and we made apple turnovers and watched hook (1991)

# Monday
Holy cow. Nap training is finally working. I am absolutely broken. But Craig finally naps all by himself. We slept for an hour and then the second nap was shorter at 40 minutes, short of the 3 hours but still a big win. We went to the YMCA open gym and had a blast. 1 full hour of tumbling around. Craig has a HUGE smile. Went out to dinner with Amelia in the afternoon. Great day, I'll remember the tumble gym for a long time.
