Can I create a lazy solution to bagging leaves?

# Leaves Everywhere

I HATE yardwork, but I refuse to pay someone else to do it out of stubbornness.
I especially HATE bagging leaves. 
There are leaf bagging equipment but they often share these common problems:
- Slower than bagging by hand
- Requires bag change frequently
- Underpowered

This post wil detail my "invention" that solves these problems.

# Vacuum 101

I am not a Vacuum expert, but every vacuum I have seen falls under one of two categories.

- Debris passes through shredder/fan and goes into positively pressurized container (dust collectors, leaf vacuums)

- A negatively pressurized container has Debris sucked into it. (house vacuums)

A negatively pressurized container would be best in case I run pinecones and such through it, I wont break my vacuum fan. 
Unfortunately, a negatively pressurized container requires a solid container. 
I want to bag right into a plastic leaf bag.
Short of some really smart engineering, I wont be able to negatively pressurize a plastic bag. 
I concluded that the leaves wil have to pass through a shredder and then into a positively pressurized bag.

# Basically a dust collector for leaves

My final design came out to be... basically a dust collector for leaves.

Not in the picture is a "cyclone" that forces the leaves down and into the collection bag instead of up into the filter. 
I just wasnt sure whether the leaves would be aerodynamic enough to escape the cyclone and clog up my filter bag.
Lets try it...

# The build
I dragged my wife along to grab a push style leaf sucker/shredder off facebook marketplace.
I gave it a new carb and it started right up.

I cut off nozzle that redirected the air suction onto the ground because I know that 90 degree turn cant be good and Im not going to be pushing this during operation. 
Also, this makes it so soo dangerous.

I replaced the bag on the machine with a nozzle that will connect to the collector bag.
Also, this bypasses more safety features.

Finally I actually had this harbor freight dust collector hanging around from my woodshop.

# Does it work

It works!!!

look at that vortex...

# Room for improvement

Here are some changes I will be making to it in my non-existant free time
- Welding the dust collector bag to the main vacuum so it can be moved as one entity
- Using some sort of elestic band to connect the leaf bag to the dust collector

# Here are some design problems

- It's far from safe
- Twigs get caught in the input forcing me to occasionally turn it off to unclog
- I need to clean the carb every season for some reason. I wish they made these things electric.

# Conclusion

I'm going on my third season with this thing. I love it. I honestly think it save me time and a little bit of bag space by shredding the leaves!
