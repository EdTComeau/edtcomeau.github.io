The goal of this post is to take someone from no understanding of quantum chemistry to kind of understanding the structure of an atom.

# How to read Math
First off, we need to be able to recognize different types of math equations.
## Algebraic equations
These are equations you learned in algebra. They are usually organized into one of two categories:
- Linear
- Polynomial

### Linear
These equations can be put in the form:
$$ a_{1}x_{1} + ... + a_{n}x_{n} + b = 0 $$

Which doesn't look like anything I ever saw in algebra class, but lets take this for example:

$$ a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} + b = 0 $$

lets say
- $a_{1}$ = constant m
- $x_{2}$ = a variable other than x, lets call it Y instead
- $a_{2}$ = -1

we get:

$$ mx_{1}-Y+b=0 $$

or

$$ Y = mX+b$$

Soo $Y=mx+b$ is an example of a linear equation. There are other examples, but baically you can add as many variables as you want as long as there are no exponents like $Y=mx^2+b$ then you have a...

### Polynomial
These are simiar to linear equations, although they have variables raised to certain powers (called degrees).
- quadratic is second degree like $Y=mX^2+b$
- cubic is third degree like $Y=mX^3+b$
- quartic is 4
- quintic is 5
- sextic is 6
- septic is 7
- octic is 8

Technically a linear equation is a first order polynomial, but we often seperate these because the method of solving them is very different. 

### Solving algebraic equations
All of these equations represent a mapping between X and Y. If you give us an X-value, we can use an algabraic equation to provide a X value. 

## Differential Equations
Okay we have a handle on algebraic equations, now some calculus. I often turn to physics to intuitively understand these.

Take a car driving in a straight line
- Car A's position = A
- time = t
 
$$ A = 20t $$

At time 0, the position is 0, at time 10 the position is 200. This is a linear equation and it is already solved, every time has an associated distance. 

Now if A = Car A's distance, A' (pronounced "A prime") would be the first derivitive. A derivitive is a change in something. A change in distance is velocity, so a change in A is A', the derivitive of A is A'. This is really important. 

if R = how much rice I have in my house
R' is the derivitive of R, or a change in the amount of rice I have in my house (ie buying rice)

if W = how much water is in my bucket
W' is the derivitive of W and is the flow rate of water into my bucket

So remember our equation for the car:

$$ A = 20t $$

What if instead of telling you one car is twice as far as the other I instead told you one car is moving with a velocity of 20. This is the equation.

$$ A' = 20 $$
Calculus is all about how to "solve" these but Im not going to teach calculus here. The solution the above equation is:

$$ A = 20t + C $$ 

where
- C is a constant value, unknown

This means that $A=20t$ is ONE solution but so is $A=20t+10$. In fact there are infinite solutions! So asking you to "Solve" the derivitive has infinite solutions. What does this mean?!

Lets remove the math, I am asking you "A car is going 20mph, whats its location". Your answer should be... "It depends where the car started". The C value in $A=20t+c$ is the starting location. Almost all the time, when we "solve" a differential equation, our answer will be a set of infinite equations. 

After we solve a differential equation, we often need to "apply boundy conditions" so that we can narrow down the infinite solutions. In the car example, we have infinite solutions, but by saying, _the car starts at a speed of zero_ we are setting a boundry condition and we have one unique solution!

### Ordinary Differential equation
In the above example I am taking a derivitive with respect to time. I am looking at the distance as it changes in time. This is because there is a relationship between A and time A->t. We can have multiple variables, as long as all the variables are being derived with respect to time this is an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE).

ODE's can be somewhat simple to "solve", but remember that your solution could be an infinite set of equations.

### Partial Differential Equation
ODEs (above) are when you take all your derivitives with respect to the same variable. Partial differential equations are basically a more complicated version of that, where you can the derivitives with respect to OTHER variables. 

To do this we can no longer use the Y' notation. We need to specify what variable we are using to derive. If we are deriving A with respect to time we would say $\dfrac{\partial A}{\partial t} $ which is pronounced "the partial derivitive of A with respect to t".

Solving these are complicated. Sometimes you get lucky and you can seperate the partial derivitives, other times you need to transform your equations into something that has already been solved. 

## Putting it all together
WOW!

Thats a lot we just covered. But you SHOULD now be able to read almost any math equation and kind of understand the goal.

# The atom model is more complex than you probably think

Imagine an atom...

Did you think of something like this:
![Atom](\images\Parts-of-an-Atom-Diagram.jpg)

Thats probably how you were taught, but the reality is the atom is so much cooler! 
We will have to dive into a lot of physics/chemistry to unveil its secrets.

# 1 The wave equation

We will be investigating the nature of electrons, but first you must understand the wavelike nature of an electron. 

If we shoot electrons through a piece of paper with two slits like this:
![DoubleSlit](\images\Double-slit.svg.png)

The piece of paper behind looks like this:
![DoubleSlitResult](\images\250px-Young's_slits.jpg)

If electrons were particles, they wouldn't look like this. There would be two clumps. The pattern you see here is the results of wave-like interference. Because of this experiment (and many others) we can assume small particles also act like waves.

What do I mean by waves?
![wave](\images\1DWave.gif)

I mean a wave equation, the particle doesn't actually LOOK like a wave. This is a generalized wave equation:

$$ \dfrac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} = \dfrac{1}{v^2} \dfrac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} $$

with u is the amplitude of the wave at position x and time t, and v is the velocity of the wave. This is a linear partial differential equation, and generally when we "solve" these we will be trying to define the u(x,t).

For example:
One end of a string is held still: $ u(0,t)=0 $
The other end of the string (length L) is held still: $ u(L,t)=0 $

There are still infinite solutions to the linear partial differential equation, but we can narrow it down a lot better now. 

![solutions](\images\Standing_waves_on_a_string.gif)
Here are six possible solutions. Later we will touch upon how to solve these. 
Notice that every solution has one more node than its successor. 
Remember that we will need to add some boundary conditions in order to figure out what equation is the true solution.

# 2 Lets quickly derive the schrodenger equation

Remember the equation for a wave:

$$ \dfrac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} = \dfrac{1}{v^2} \dfrac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} $$

Let's swap out the velocity of a wave for the light speed constant and the nasty doubel derivitive with the Laplacian 

$$ \nabla^2 \Psi(x,y,z,t) -\dfrac{1}{c^2}\dfrac{\partial ^2 \Psi(x,y,z,t) }{\partial t^2}=0 $$

This is all okay to do because Maxwells Equation's (Equations that define how energy works) allow us to simulate a particle with a 3-D wave. 
This is the first hand-wavy part of this description. You may need to trust me that particles can be described as waves here. 

So this has four dimensions, x,y,z,t (time). It helps to think of it in one dimension, lets say x...
$ \Psi(x)=f\left(\dfrac {2\pi x}{ \lambda}\right) $







SO maybe you have heard that an electron is a particle and a wave? So contemporary phyiscs assumes things are particles, if we want to get into the very small (quantum) world we must look at the wave-like nature of a particle. 


this is unfinished and will be later...
