I have had a kid. I am having a second soon. Here is my list of baby essentials.

# Things to do while pregnant
List of things you NEED before the baby comes. 

## Bassinet
You typically will need a bassinet for baby to sleep in for the first 6mo. For better or worse, my wife and I didn't want our baby to cry at all so a regular bassinet didn't work we upgraded to a bassinet that rocks and soothes. Snoo and mama-roo have good ones. The tradeoff is that crib transitioning may be harder and while I found no evidence soothing bassinets were dangerous, they are definitely new and there is an inherent risk. 
We used the snoo. This worked wonders for us and I think it was worth every penny. You can rent these things if you want to trial it for a bit. 

## car seat
I suggest the bucket type with detachable base. If and when baby falls asleep you can take them out of the car without disturbing them.

## stroller
It's a huge hand to have one, walking outside is one of the few things you can do to stay awake with a baby. Highly suggest one that accepts your car seat or has an adapter for that. Moving from the car to stroller is so much easier when you can just lift the car seat out and put it on the stroller.

## diapers and wipes
I haven't found any brand that doesn't work. Size newborn diapers and wipes.

That's it!! Not too bad. But if you have time, I would try to get as far down the list as possible before the baby comes. Your free time will severely diminish. 

# things you need once the baby is here
You don't need these the day you come home, but you probably will soon.

 ## clothes
Sizes are intuitive, they go by age. 
When picking clothes I mostly look for one thing, diaper access. You are going to be changing diapers often and if you need to undo thirteen buttons, two zippers, and a padlock to get to that diaper, you are going to hate diaper changes.
Zippers are better than buttons, zippers that can zip up or down is quite the luxury and the pinnacle of diaper changing simplicity.

Also while you are thinking of it, switch your washer detergent to a baby detergent.  

## bottles
I like glass bottles. I can throw them in the dishwasher and not worry about the plastic absorbing detergent. Then I hand wash the nipples.

If you are formula feeding- You may need a lot more than you think. Babies eat once every 2 hours so if you want to prefill for a 10 hour night you need 5 -6 bottles. 

There are different sizes bottle nipples for different ages. 

## breast pump
If you can afford it, you may want to get two sets of all the washable bits. Washing these things is annoying and having two sets will help.

There are fancy ones that are hands free. My wife recommends these. 

## med kit
Digital thermometer; Label it "butt" in sharpie. Vaseline, to help the butt thermometer. Nose suction thing, it's a bulb. Diaper cream. Infant Tylenol might be a good idea, you will need it at some point and when your baby has a cold isn't a fun time to make a cvs run.

## binkies
Buy more than you need, you will lose them at the most inconvenient times.

That is it! With these bare necessities you may have everything you need for a while! This list why last forever, but should cover you for the newborn stage.


# fancy things you might not know about

## baby cameras
There are some fancy ones that will monitor your babies breathing. Babies make a lot of odd noises, if you are anxious this might be nice.
We got the Motorola mbp36. It has worked reliably for us from bassinet to crib. You can move it when baby moves, and has all the setting we could really want. 

## baby rocker
Something to put baby down. White noise and back and forth rocking are amazing. There are some serious risks to letting your baby sleep in these, be aware of that. They are handy for putting baby down for dishes/showers/eating where you can keep them in eyesight.

## health monitors
We got a thing that monitors spo2 levels. It helps with anxiety, so it was well worth it for us. If you aren't anxious, don't worry about these. They might not even work. Maybe your baby monitor does this, then it is definitely overkill.

## formula stuff
If you do formula feeding there are things that will mis it for you, heat the formula, and disinfect. Some can save some time. 

## white noise machines
Not only do they comfort and soothe, they block out other noises, so you can do the dishes without waking baby. Battery power is a plus, if the power goes out or you are traveling it will keep your baby asleep.
