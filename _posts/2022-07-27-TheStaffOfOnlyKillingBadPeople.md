# Intro
Evil Human Resources Officer, Peggy- "We are SO excited to have you here, I heard you have previous experience working as an evil henchman?"

You- "Lots of experience"

Peggy- "Thats greaaaaat. Somethings you have to know. 1) Try not to question the boss too much 2) You caught us in a bit of a transition and we may soon be pivoting to doing good in the world"

You- "You will still pay the same, if we pivot to good?"

Peggy- "hahaha of course, probably, why don't you go on in there and meet the boss. He read all about you and wants you to be his right hand man!"


# Day 1
You push open the giant doors to a giant room filled with mostly empty space except for a giant throne in the front. Evil henchmen are walking about. You approach Mr. E, on his throne.

You- "Nice to meet you, I heard I am going to be your right hand man."

Mr. E- "Take a seat next to me, you got here at a busy time" Motions to the other Evil henchmen "Have you got the staff?" 
Evil Henchman- "we got it sir" 

Mr. E- "You got that *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* I asked for"

Evil Henchman- "Yepp, the staff that is like the one from Moonknight, Disneys newest addition to the marvel family"

Mr. E- "Great we can begin our plan"

You - "Pardon my ignorance, but I dont get it."

Mr. E- "What don't you get? *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* touches you, if you are good you live, if you are bad you die."

You- "isn't good and bad pretty relative terms? Like a man stealing food may seem bad to the store owner but is pretty good if he is using it to feed his kids."

Mr. E- "The *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* calculates the utility function of a person existing, so it isn't relative, it is global"

You- "Okay, I'll bite, if it has infinite knowledge maybe it can make a utility calculation, there is no guarantee that utility function will align with what you and I consider good."

Mr. E- "We thought of that" 

You- "If there is a rare amoeba that can reproduce and live in bliss as soon as the human race dies, wouldn't the staff kill everyone?"

Mr. E- "We thought of that"

You- "What do you mean you though of it"

Mr. E- "Bring in Steve, Steve here is a scientist for secret agency x. Steve created a compound that we have in our drinking water that prevents millions of human deaths a year."

You- "Just because Steve is good for humans doesn't mean he is good for the world, what if us humans just deplete resources from some hyper intelligent alien life for..."

*A scientist wearing a glove gives Steve a bonk on the head with the staff.*

Steve-"what was that for?"

*The room grows quiet*

Mr. E-"Oh thank goodness that worked"

You-"You didn't know!" 

Mr. E-"Nope, but we figured if it saves one person, Steve would be our best bet. And if *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* saves one person then we can guess that humans are providing something positive to this universe, so it should work." 

You-"So you didn't know this would even work until just now?"

Mr. E-"Yeah basically, but we know it works! We will continue our testing tomorrow"


# Day 2
Everyone is finishing their evil breakfast in the chamber.

You- "Okay I had another thought"

Mr. E-"Go ahead." 

You- "If your plan is to go around bonking people on the head with *The Staff Of Killing Bad People*, word will get around. People, might change their behavior so that they don't get killed by the staff. What if a bad person made a promise that if they ever ran into you with the staff they would change their ways"

Mr. E-"Seems like the staff would still be doing its job, getting rid of 'bad' people by changing them"

You-"Yeah but it can go the other way. What if I made a sincere promise, as long as my nemesis isn't killed by the *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* I will do something horrible, like dump a bunch of oil into the ocean. As long as those are my true intentions, the staff will have to weigh that into it's utility function and kill my nemesis"

Mr. E-"But if your nemesis lives, you would have no reason to follow through. The *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* would know this"

You-"Yeah, but I could rig up a contraption, a contraption that is programmed to leak oil into the ocean if the staff let's my nemesis live"

Mr. E-"Okay I see where you are going with this, let's test it"

You-"How?!"

Mr. E-"Bring in Steve!!"

Steve- "oh no not again"

Mr. E- "Evil henchmen, if we bonk Steve with *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* and he lives, you must find a volcano somewhere near a village and make it explode"

Steve- "Why would you say thaa *bonk*"

*Not a sound in the chamber*

*Everyones exhails.*

*Evil henchmen start filing out of the chamber with a comically large ray-gun that says volcano exploder on the side...*

You-"You aren't going to have them actually do that are you?"

Mr. E-"I think I have to..."


# Day 3
Mr. E- "I think we can ask the staff questions"

You- "What do you mean" 

Mr. E- "I mean, if I train and pay one of my henchmen to do some action, depending on if the staff let's them live. I would essentially know if that action is good." 

You-"Okay"

Mr. E-"So if I told my henchmen that if *The Staff Of Killing Bad People* allows them to live, they should devote their life to spreading the word wide and far that people need to stop driving cars. The staff would then 'decide' if that is a good thing."

You-"Wouldn't it only be deciding if it does a little good, not if it was effective at saving the world"

Mr. E-"Yeah, I could also instruct my henchmen to evaluate their intervention after 5 years and blow up a volcano if it didn't significantly change the world?"
You murmer to yourself- "always the volcano thing."

You-"Yeah, you could pick some law. Hire a henchman to devote their life to lobby for that law, but if they get the law in place and it isn't wildly considered a big improvement then they should blow up a volcano. You could technically determine if that law is good or not."

Mr E- "I could make a list of ways I think I could change the world. Give one henchman half of the list, and tell him that if the staff let's him live his job is to help me figure out what on that list is the most important"

You- "Yeah I see"

Mr. E- "I could run my whole plan from this chamber and I wouldn't have to go with the plan where I bonk every living sould on the head with this staff"

You- "Was THAT really your plan up until just now?"

Mr. E- "Bring in Steve!!"


# Day 4
*You Walk into the chamber to the sound of Steve getting bonked on the head over and over.*

You- "What are you testing now"

Mr E-"Well I had a thought."

You-"What is it"

Mr E-"What if someone stole from me, an evil scientist. I have a lot of money, and honestly wouldn't notice it missing. If that money helped the person, most likely the staff will be okay with it. Stealing is bad, but if it does more good than bad than the staff is okay with it."

You-"Yeah the staff wouldn't punish people for doing bad things if the world ends up a better place for it"

Mr E-" Yeah, all the robin hoods out there would get a pass. That's why I keep forcing Steve to steal money from me, and then I *bonk* see if the staff kills him"
You-"I'm going to take an early lunch"

Mr E-"Okay, I'll tell you if it kills Steve"



*You are walking back from lunch*

Mr E- "Help, Help me!!"

*You run into the chamber to find Mr. E cowering in the corner with Steve standing over him with the The Staff Of Killing Bad People*

You- "Steve, you are a good person! Look at how you are holding that staff with your bear hands! Clearly killing Mr. E by hitting him with the staff isn't what you are supposed to do!"

Steve- "I don't care about the staff, I just want to go home!"

You- "Look, if you hit Mr. E with the staff he will surely die because of all the terrible things he has done. If that happens we cannot let you just walk out of here. Just put down the staff and we will let you leave."

Steve- "Maybe I'm not as good as you think I am"

*Steve swings the The Staff Of Killing Bad People and hits Mr. E on the head*

*Immediately Mr. E coils up and lets out a loud shriek*

*The room grows quiet*

*Mr E looks at his trembling hands and closes his eyes... then opens them*

Mr. E- "I am still here"

*Henchmen grab steve* 

You- "You must be a truly good person, if the staff let you live"

*Mr E inspects the staff*

Mr. E- "Whoops, I really should have looked at this more closely when the henchmen gave it to me a couple days ago. This isn't the *The Staff Of Killing Bad People*, this is just a regular staff"
