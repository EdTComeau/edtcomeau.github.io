title: Beware of the U Shaped Curve

# U shape curve in action

The following are links to examples of what I will be talking about. The titles are sometimes mine, but pulled from the conclusions. 

[abstainers ... show increased mortality risks ... compared to moderate drinkers.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01286.x)

[Light to moderate coffee consumption is associated with lower risk of death](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35048949/)

[moderate levels of screen time  ... associated with slightly higher levels of psychosocial functioning compared to lower](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(19)31437-6/fulltext)

# What is going on here

Studies show that people who do this (bad) thing we all do, x, are healthier than people who don't do x at all!

Research likes this compares people who moderately engage in an activity to people who completely abstain from that activity. Somehow, moderately engaging in that activity provides health benefits! There is a problem with this comparison. When researchers are recording a behavior that the average person does (i.e. drink moderately, eat chocolate) then the people abstaining from activity that are not average in some way.

For example: Imagine someone who completely abstains from alcohol. It might be because they just chose not to drink, but it also might be because they are too ill to drink, hospitalized, in a care home, or recovering from alcohol or another addiction. Whatever the reason, they are different from the average person. This means it will be easy to find some reportable difference.

This effect often presents itself as a U shaped curve where people who abstain from X and people who frequently X both have some sort of negative health outcome. This leads the reader to assume that X is somehow healthy in moderation. This is often far from the truth.

# Examples:

Here are some more examples to drive the point home. I don't claim that I am giving explainations here, I am just giving examples of how this may happen.

People who moderately eat chocolate are healthier than those who don't eat chocolate.
- A lot of chocolate abstainers might have diabetes.

People who moderately drink coffee live longer than those who don't drink coffee.
- People not drinking coffee may be getting caffeine through unhealthy energy drinks or sugary drinks instead.

People who moderately engage in social media are healthier than those who don't.
- Older generations, with more health issues, don't use social media.

# Conclusion

I think the researchers know: 

- correlation doesn't mean causation
- survey studies are not trustworthy 
- these studies can be used as probes to help guide better randomized control trials

The problem here is news media seems to eat these articles up and make bold claims. 

[Surprising Ways Alcohol May Be Good for You](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-alcohol-health-benefits)

[Cane Sugar: Are There Health Benefits?](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-cane-sugar#1)

I try to look out for this U shaped curve any time I see an exciting correlation. These claims often reinforce some behavior of mine, so it is especially tricky to catch.

# Extras
[This article actually claims that eating chocolate snacks results in reduced diabetes... Its the other way around](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19818197/)

[Not a U shaped curve, but it's a probably causation correlation issue all the same... People who moderately brush their teeth live longer!](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124861/)

Also, have you ever tried to get research articles on Chocolate? I have never seen a topic that is so filled with CLEARLY biased fake research articles. This might be a topic for a later post.
