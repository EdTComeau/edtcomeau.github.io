## SO what is this DESE
Massachusetts offers several pathways to meet the licensure requirements:

You need to go to school, then get DESE certified.
School has 3 routes:
-  Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT): Ideal for individuals seeking both licensure and a graduate degree, MAT programs combine coursework with supervised teaching experiences. This route is well-suited for career changers or those who want to strengthen their subject expertise while earning licensure.
  -  Post-baccalaureate licensure programs: Designed for those who already hold a bachelor’s degree in another field and need a structured, state-approved pathway to licensure without pursuing a full master’s degree. These programs focus on the necessary coursework and field experience required for certification.
 -   Alternative licensure routes: Some individuals may qualify for preliminary licensure, allowing them to teach while completing additional coursework to meet full licensure requirements. These programs often involve mentorship and professional development support.

THe Cert has three stages:

-  Preliminary license: Available to you if you have a bachelor’s degree but no formal teacher preparation, which can allow you to begin teaching immediately while working toward an initial license.
  -  Initial license: Requires completing a teacher preparation program, passing the Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure (MTEL), and completing a supervised practicum which often takes two to three years depending on the program.
 -   Professional license: Obtained after at least three years of teaching under an initial license and completing either a master’s degree or an equivalent professional development program and is the highest level of classroom licensure that’s renewed every five years.

From what I read MAT or Masters in Arts Teaching is the way to go as the post-bacc is often just a few credit hours short of a superior looking MAT.

SO we are looking for a program that ideally facilitates this all.

## Programs

| Program                   | Licensure? | Online Format    | Cost Estimate                           | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Merrimack College (M.Ed.) | Yes (DESE) | Online or Hybrid | Private; fellowships available          | Flexible schedule, field experience included  |
| Fitchburg State (M.Ed.)   | Yes (DESE) | Fully Online     | \~\$385/credit; < \$15K total           | Affordable, cohort-based, NEASC accredited    |
| UMass Lowell (M.Ed.)      | Yes (DESE) | Fully Online     | Competitive; aid/scholarships available | Very flexible, field placement supported      |
| Mount Holyoke (MAT)       | Yes (DESE) | Fully Online     | Likely higher; aid available            | Wide subject offerings, 1–2-yr pacing options |

If affordability is your top concern, Fitchburg State is a standout with high-quality licensure options at a low cost—especially the 5–12 online track.

For maximum flexibility and scheduling control, UMass Lowell offers full asynchronous delivery (except fieldwork) and strong support for working professionals.

Merrimack gives a nice balance of structure and cost, with additional financial benefits and cohort flexibility.

Mount Holyoke’s MAT is ideal if you're seeking broad subject area offerings and a socially engaged learning environment—though likely a premium option.
