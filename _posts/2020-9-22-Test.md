# Big Baby
When expecting a baby, ultrasounds are able to predict the weight of a baby, but they are known to be inacurate. 

Here I attempt to quantify the innacuracy and place a probability on a baby's birth weight. I found some interesting things along the way. 

## Assumptions

### Method of measurement
<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30244476/>

There are a few different ways to estimate the current weight of a baby. The hadlock method seems best, here is an example formula:

>Hadlock 4: Log10 (weight) =1.3596 -0.00386* AC * FL+0.0064* HC+0.00061* BPD* AC+ 0.0424* AC+0.174*FL

* AC = Abdominal Circumfrence
* FL = Femur Length
* BPD = Biparietal Diameter (ear to ear distance)
* HC = Head Circumfrence

## The data set
I found a data set 
<https://www.kaggle.com/c/csci-ml-s19-pa1/data>
. It is difficult to pinpoint where this dataset came from but I was told it was real data from a hospital system. **Lets assume this data is garbage and everything about this is for the fun of Data Science and not actually informative**

## Code
Below is the chunk of code I used to analyze expected birthweights, feel free to skip over it if you have no intention of replicating this. 
    import os
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


    def file_to_dataframe(file_name):
        """Makes a pandas table out of a specifically names file"""
        basepath = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        data_file = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(basepath, file_name + '.csv'))
        try:
            with open(data_file) as f:
                dataframe = pd.read_csv(f) # pd is pandas
            return dataframe
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
            print('failed to read file')
            exit()


    def my_percentile(data, Value):
        """Give me data and a value and I will return the percentile of that value"""
        # To do this we sort the data then count the events below it
        sorted_data = sorted(data)
        lower = min(range(len(sorted_data)), key=lambda i: abs(sorted_data[i] - Value))
        rev_sorted_data = sorted(data, reverse=True)
        higher = min(range(len(rev_sorted_data)), key=lambda i: abs(rev_sorted_data[i] - Value))
        total = lower + higher
        percentile = lower / total
        return percentile

        main_dataframe = file_to_dataframe(file_name)
        print('Imported:')

        # Get the birth weights after week 37 before week 41
        expected_week_earliest = 37
        expected_week_latest = 41
        normal = main_dataframe.loc[main_dataframe['WEEKS'] >= expected_week_earliest]
        normal = normal.loc[main_dataframe['WEEKS'] <= expected_week_latest]

        # Compute frequency and bins
        frequency, bins = np.histogram(normal['BWEIGHT'], bins=50)

        # Max min
        normal = normal[np.abs(normal.BWEIGHT - normal.BWEIGHT.mean()) <= (3 * normal.BWEIGHT.std())]
        maximum = normal['BWEIGHT'].max()
        minimun = normal['BWEIGHT'].min()

        # Make the distribution
        x = normal['BWEIGHT']
        plt.hist(x, bins=50)
        frequency_plot = plt.gca().set(title='Frequency Histogram', ylabel='Frequency');
        plt.show(block=frequency_plot)
        plt.clf()

        # Predicted weight
        predicted_weight = 9.5

        # percentile calculator
        predicted_percentile = my_percentile(normal['BWEIGHT'], predicted_weight)

        # Tell
        print(
            f'A baby estimated at {predicted_weight}lb by the Hadlock Method baby is in the {predicted_percentile * 100:.2f} Percentile')

        # ten percent error
        min_weight = predicted_weight - .1 * predicted_weight
        max_weight = predicted_weight + .1 * predicted_weight

        predicted_min_percentile = my_percentile(normal['BWEIGHT'], min_weight)
        predicted_max_percentile = my_percentile(normal['BWEIGHT'], max_weight)

        less_range = predicted_percentile - predicted_min_percentile
        more_range = predicted_max_percentile - predicted_percentile

        less_percent = less_range / (less_range + more_range)
        more_percent = more_range / (less_range + more_range)

        # Tell
        print(
            f'Your baby is {less_percent * 100:.1f}% likely to be between {min_weight:.1f}lbs and {predicted_weight}lbs, but probably closer to {predicted_weight}')
        print(
            f'Your baby is {more_percent * 100:.1f}% likely to be between {predicted_weight}lbs and {max_weight:.1f}lbs but probably closer to {predicted_weight}')

        # lets check on likelyhood of birth injury
        # First lets squeeze down the window to the 10% range
        normal_avgs = normal.mean(axis=0)
        select = normal.loc[normal['BWEIGHT'] >= min_weight]
        select = select.loc[select['BWEIGHT'] <= max_weight]
        select_avgs = select.mean(axis=0)

        # Tell
        summary = normal_avgs.to_frame(name='norm').join(select_avgs.to_frame(name='Select'))
        pd.set_option("display.max_rows", None, "display.max_columns", None)
        print(summary.iloc[52:, :])

## Analysis
First off lets look at the distribution of these births
