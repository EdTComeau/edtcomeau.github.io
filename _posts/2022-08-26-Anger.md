title: Anger
---

You sit in a line of cars waiting to get off the freeway at your exit. 
You drive this every day, so you got to the right lane about a half mile early so you could wait in this line. 
You look out your window to the lane next to you, cars whizzing by. 
There is no traffic on the rest of the freeway, just your exit. 
You daydream of moving like them. 
Your dream is disrupted by a minivan, coming from the fast lane across two lanes of traffic. 
The minivan swerves across traffic with his horn blazing coming right for you. 
You panic momentarily thinking he is going to hit you, but he stops, right next to you, the front of his car angled right in front of you. 
You breathe a sigh of relief as the minivan driver is gesturing and honking at the 5 speeding cars he just swerved in front of. 
Now his attention focuses on you. 
You see his blinker come on; he wants to get off at your exit; he wants to squeeze in in front of you. 
You see other people make this move daily, honestly, it's just a rookie mistake, he wasn't trying to cheat the system, or cut the line he probably just didn't realize this was his exit. 
As soon as the car in front of you moves, you will allow him the space he needs to move in. 
Then he honks at you. 
Okay, nowhere to go here the car in front of you is still three inches from your bumper and not moving. 
You look at the driver and while he makes eye contact with you, he slams the horn and points where he wants to go. 
You still can't move at all. 
You have no choice but to stare ahead attempting to ignore the slurs and honking coming from the man insisting you allow him to cut you off.

# Anger

The above is the first story that came to my mind when I wanted to describe pure anger. 
The unhealthy type of anger, where I would be smiling if a police officer gave him a ticket, or his car stops working. 
I want something bad to happen to him (but not horrible, for the record).

Being angry can't be healthy right? Angry enough and some people lose the ability to think straight. 
Is there ever a benefit to being angry?

Here are some unorganized thoughts on anger.

## 1 Anger can be loss of control (Bad)

Stealing this thought process from somewhere else:
If someone had a ray-gun that they could shoot at you, and it made you mad would you let them shoot you?
Probably not.
Then let's replace the word "ray-gun" with "mean words and attitude".
If someone had a mean words and attitude that they could [send your way] and it made you mad, would you let them do that?
If you let someone's mean words and attitude effect your emotional state, you might as well be allowing them to shoot you with the "angry" ray gun. 
You are allowing someone else to define your emotions.
You are inviting someone in your head.

This isn't a perfect example because "words and actions" can mean anything. 
I still like this because it exemplifies that when you are angry at someone you are allowing them in your head, which they don't deserve at all. 
In fact, getting angry is letting the aggressor win.

## 2 to be angry is to be irrational (Bad)

I would argue that you are angry once you start making decisions you wouldn't make when you are levelheaded.

If you feel like this isn't a fair definition, then replace the word "angry" in this prose with the phrase "angry enough to act irrational".

If you feel like, some people act irrationally while angry but not me, I think clearly and make calculated decisions while angry. 
I really think you are wrong, but I think proving that could be a whole post. 
If emotions are worth talking about, then they must change your behavior somehow. 
If you agree that we act differently while happy, sad, angry then you agree that our decision process changes based off mood. 
I have left a bit to prove here, but maybe you get where I am going. 
I don't believe anyone is immune, we all have the ability to act irrational while angry.

And that is bad.

## 3 anger is not a good feeling (Bad)

I don't think anyone would choose to feel angry purposefully, it is not a pleasant feeling.

## 4 anger can focus your attention (Good and bad)

Here, I am thinking of Facebook posts where something makes people angry, and then is shared a lot.

What do you think is going to get more shares/likes/subscribes

> For some unknown reason, the drinking water in your town is bad. 
> Please spread the word.

> Evil co. Is knowingly dumping acid into our towns water supply. 
> Please spread the word.

In both above cases, the effect is the same, unsafe water. 
One story gives you someone to be angry at, and I would predict it would get more traction.

### Anger as an attention getter... 
This can be a good and a bad thing (and a medium thing).

#### Good thing:
Anger can drive positive change. 
If people get angry about working conditions they can fight for, and eventually better their working conditions. 

#### Medium thing:
You can use anger to draw attention to the otherwise ignored. 
This attention is used for good or bad.

i.e., No one is paying attention to your proposal to put in bird feeders at the new park...

You put out a flyer that says
> "Ken Smith hates birds. 
> He goes to pet store occasionally and punches birds, he hates birds so  much he is trying to block a bill that would put bird feeders in this park. 
> Help me stop the bird hating Ben hurt more birds, help me put bird feeders in this new park."

#### Bad thing:
A bad person is running for Senate. 
This bad person has no qualifications and a long history of bad things, and plans on doing bad things once elected. 
Instead of campaigning on changes they would like to make they run an ad campaign that makes out the opposition to be a horrible person that you should be mad at. 
They spend every debate talking about how mad you should be at their opponent. 
Everyone is so furious at OPPOSITION that they forget to ask what the senator plans on doing. 
*This one accidentally got too real, sorry.

## 5 game theory anger (good)

Anger serves an important purpose in game theory. 
Anger/vengeance makes the world a better place in this way.

Let's say I am playing RISK or monopoly against my family. 
I know that my wife is especially vengeful in board games and if I attack her, she will suddenly care more about getting back at me than she cares about winning. 
This is irrational of her, but a result of anger.
The fact that I know my wife will go scorched earth on me if I attack her, is a really good deterrent.
The very fact that I know my wife would get angry at me, keeps her safe and keeps me more peaceful towards her.

So, if I know that people act irrationally when they are angry, I am going to be more careful not to upset anyone. 
Imagine a world without anger. 
A man could walk down the street giving everyone the middle finger. 
People would see the middle finger, get offended but nothing that merits intervention of any kind. 
Well in a world with anger, the middle finger guy just needs to upset one person with an especially short fuse who might retaliate.

In this way anger makes the world a better place.

## 6 anger as therapy (Good)

I am not psychologist, but I have heard people much smarter than me say that suppressing your feelings is bad. 
This aligns with my experience too.

If you feel the need to feel sad, at some point you should allow yourself to feel sad otherwise this sadness will transform or grow and even become a bigger problem.

Does the same thing go for anger? The very unhealthy reasons for hiding sadness may be
-to avoid showing "weakness"
-to avoid getting hurt
-lack of confidence
Seems the only "correct" reason to suppress anger is if you fear acting irrationally.

There are three main techniques for dealing with anger. 
Expressing, suppressing, and calming.
All techniques are not equally as desired.

### Expression
Even anger management seems to teach that expressing anger is the healthiest option. 
Being able to recognize you are angry and communicate this in a healthy manner.
this means no yelling or losing your temper. 
This is an option if you can act rationally while also angry.

### Suppression
Suppressing anger can lead to some problems. 
If you don't address your anger, it can worsen and pop up in different unhealthy ways like passive aggression or avoidance.

### Calming
Calming is a method of addressing the feelings of anger. 
So, allowing anger to preside, but also calming down so you don't act irrationally.

So, if you read this whole post and conclude that anger is bad, and I should avoid it. 
Remember that suppressing anger is bad and will make you worse off for it.

## 7 Anger as a secondary emotion? (Good)
Secondary emotions are emotions that are created by other primary emotions.

> happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger are often cited as primary emotions.

> guilt, shame, confusion, resentment, frustration, and remorse are often listed as secondary emotions.

I have seen some claims that anger is a secondary emotion. 
Seems like one of those weird things where if I Google it, top 10 results say anger is a secondary emotion. 
But if I go on Wikipedia or even follow the citation trail, most things academic says anger is a primary emotion.

Some papers just dismissed this as a pseudo-problem. 
While it would be neat and tidy to say all anger is elicited from anxiety, or rather say that anger is always the driving emotion... 
We all know emotions are complex and it is very possible that anger can sometimes be a primary emotion and sometimes be a secondary emotion.

I would put this in the good category, for anger. 
I think anger is a very recognizable emotion and if other emotions need to elicit anger to get some attention, well now at least they will be listened to.

Anger can be a sign that you need to
- Redefine some personal boundaries
- Deal with sadness/disgust/fear/surprise
- Need to resolve a conflict
- Need to manage expectations

## 8 anger as a canary in a coal mine (Good)

I think it is hard to constantly be thinking, "am I being treated fairly here?"
I love to go to the grocery store without having to cognitively think, am I being taken advantage of here.

The idea of some separate process of my brain that will make me angry if I am being taken advantage of is great!
Yeah, sometimes it's wrong. 
But by having this subprocess looking out for me, I can be cognitively focusing on other things, like enjoying the moment.

I think it is very important. 
If in the grocery store, I need to constantly be thinking, "is it fair that I need to wait for this guy to move his shopping cart?" 
I would be stressed out feeling like I always need to be evaluating the situation for unfairness. 
Luckily, I can happily go about shopping knowing that I will feel myself get angry if I start to feel taken advantage of.

Using anger as an alert, "maybe you are being taken advantage of right now" can allow you to be a happier person. 
You don't need to worry too much about blatant boundary violations, your "anger alert" will go off when this happens. 
Then when anger shows up, you can use that as a sign that you need to pay attention for a bit.

This whole section may sound is a bit naive. 
I understand that people really trying to take advantage of you will try to do it without eliciting angry emotions. 
I never would argue that "trusting your gut/emotions" is a way to live life, think rationally! 
But even for the rational thinker, it may give you comfort knowing you have a built-in warning system for when you may need to pay attention to an interaction.

## conclusions
I have been thinking about anger a lot recently. 
Clearly.

Should I be making a greater effort to be less angry?
If a genie came out of bottle and said, “I can make the world's anger go away" would I make the wish?

All and all I don't think I would ever wish away anger. 
I think some of the most horrible things in the world happen because of anger, but those come to mind quickly because of negativity bias. 
I think while rarely someone with a lot of anger does bad things, on a day-to-day basis anger allows us to recognize our boundaries and actually acknowledge conflict and resolve it.
I think anger is like tool, and most people use it well and it is really helpful. 
But occasionally anger is misused or completely misunderstood and that is bad.
