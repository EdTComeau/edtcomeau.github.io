title: Ramblings about parenting

I think there are some foundational parenting questions I want resolved. 
I have a 9 month old and I am obsessed with him. I want to do everything right by him. Here are the BIG questions I am working on right now.

## How involved should I be in my childs life?
Helicopter Parents are parents who are incredibly involved in every aspect of their child's life. 
A straw-man image would be a parent that tells their kids how to play, resolves every issue that stands in their kids life, and plans out their child's activities to the minute. 
Free-Range parenting is the diametrically opposite viewpoint where children are given complete freedom. 
Children are allowed to do what they like, go where they want, and make their own mistakes. 

I think the correct level of involvement is obviously between these two extremes. 
I am self aware enough to know I probably am more of a helicopter parent than a free-ranger.

To quote the brilliant genius, Me, from my last blog post...
>Is society moving from Free range children to helicopter parenting good for the children? 
>I often cave into social norms, I think we all do. 
>Even once aware of them, it would take a really strong conviction of mine to decide to rebel and go against norms. 
>I have to pick my battles.
>I haven't seen enough convincing evidence to suggest 1980's social norms (more freedom/less hands-on) was healthier than todays (More hands-on/less freedom) so I will most likely be more of a helicopter parent than my parents were to me. 
>> Maybe a happy medium would be relishing the closer ties between parents and children now, but also recognizing that part of being a good, caring parent is letting children discover things on their own.

## What is my role as a parent
- Unconditional Loving Dad
- A Role model
- A Teacher
- A Protector
- A Provider (financial, food, clothing, etc.)
- Keeping my child happy
- A best-friend for life

I'm sure there are others I am missing. 
In a perfect world I can be all of these things, but there are times where they are at odds with one another and I need to choose.
If my son wants to build a giant bike jump, aprotector would say no, but a best friend for life would say yes. 
If my son is throwing a temper tantrum, a good role model wouldn't allow himself to be disrespected and yelled at, but a best friend and Unconditional Loving Dad would understand the feelings and help him work through it. 
These two examples are easy to resolve but it doesn't take a lot of creativity to come up with difficult ones.
- My child got into prestidious school but wants to stay with friends at other school.
- My child hangs around friends that are in my opinion "bad influences".
- My child is really into some book/show that I think is bad for some reason.
- My child wants to follow their risky passion instead of following safer career trajectory.

These all to me are harder problems because I am not sure what hat to be wearing. 
The answer I believe to be true is that I should foster a relationship where I can express my opinions, have them heard and truly evaluated, and have my child independently make their own decisions. 
If I truly believe their health / wellbeing is at risk, I can continue untervening but EVERY STEP OF THE WAY I NEED TO BE WEARING MY UNCONDITIONAL LOVING DAD HAT.

Sounds good on paper, but even in advance I know that "health / wellbeing at risk" part is going to be tricky to evaluate.

## Am I worrying too much

Here I am talking about being worried about steering my child the wrong direction, but do I even have a hand on the wheel?
Judith Rich Harris in her book The Nurture Assumption, makes the argument that parents ACTIONS don't have much of an effect on their children's outcomes. (I am told, I need to read her book; it's on my shelf.)

This is tempting to believe because it feels good and even feels true.
I know there are some extremely loving and thoughtful parents out there who raised children who have made terrible choices and ended up in horrible situations.
I am sure there are some parents whose horrible actions somehow lead to children who do amazing things in the world.
I have even repeated a phrase from my favorite podcast, Freakonomics, to my wife "A parents effects on a child is like the effects of a butterflies wings flapping amidst a hurricane"
To which my wife always replies, "I will wrap my baby up in my butterfly wings and protect him from the hurricane".

I now believe that my original sentiment is wrong.
I think parenting has a huge effect on their children.
In fact, the butterfly-hurricane scenario is awefully similar to the chaos theory "butterfly effect" that's main takeaway is that the butterfly flapping their wings is VERY important.

Research on twins and adopted children seems to prove that parenting effects outcomes, independent of DNA. 
The problem is this effect size is smaller than I would like.

My current stance is that parenting is very important, but there are variety of uncontrollable factors that are also at play. 

## How do I avoid falling into feedback traps

Parenting is dynamic, where a parent responds to feedback as they go and adjusts.

I have a lot of priors going into parenting. 
I am reading a lot of books and have a lot of opinions. 
None of my opinions / priors right are now are strong enough that I would stick to a book method or strategy once I see it failing. 
I am going to try things and throw out the stuff that doesn't work.
Because I am mostly working with feedback, I need to look out for false feedback, feeback loops, overcorrection, and other failure modes.  

### I need to avoid false feedback

An example of false feedback would be feeding my child cake everyday. 
Obviously my kid will be happy eating cake and I would feel like a great father... until the health problems start kicking in. 

I can avoid the risk of false feedback with
- Research
- Entropy optimization

#### Research
One way to mitigate this risk is research. If I can find research (rarely)telling me that what I am doing is wrong, I really need to weigh that heavily even in the face of positive feedback. This is the best method but is rarely available.

#### Entropy Maximization
Entropy Optimization, or keeping as many options available as possible is another good way to mitigate this risk. 
Chess AI's among other artificial intelligence isn't always looking for the win, they often optimize on entropy. 
In early game, Chess AI's often are just optimizing entropy, so trying to keep as many moves available as possible. 
Moving a bishop in the edge of the board allows for less moves than in the middle. 
So even when a bishop might have a better approach from the egde of the board, an AI might move them into the middle.

This form of weighting entropy as well as strategy can mitigate some risk in real life. 

Lets hypothetically say I try to spank my child (you can guess from this post I am against spanking)
I might temporarily observe that my childs bad behavior goes away, and reinforce my new found love of spanking. 
This positive feedback (reduced bad behavior) may drive me to spank more. 

Some research might tell me spanking increases behavioral problems. 
If I take my new reinforced belief that spanking works and dampen it with the research I have done, it may sway me to stop spanking. But lets say I cant find any research.

With entropy in mind:
What kid will be better adjusted, one who has been spanked for wrongdoings, or one who hasnt.
I think a child who gets hit for wrong decisions may be less adjusted than a child who gets spoken to. 
Therefore, I think by hitting a child for a wrong decision I am taking away entropy from them, by making their life a little harder.
If I take my new reinforced belief that spanking works and dampen it with the idea that I am making my child less prepared for the "real World", it may sway me away from spanking.

### feedback loops

A feedback loop could be as simple as:
I have a bad trait, X, that I accidentally view as positive.
I encourage X in my child.
Together, my child and I become more X together.

This could be as complicated as:
Correcting behavior X makes things worse before the get better.
I try to correct X but when I see a negative effect I double down.
This has a cascading effect of more negative effects due to the "doubling down"
Similar: [A Right Half Plane Zero](https://www.ti.com/seclit/ml/slup084/slup084.pdf)

I think risk of feedback loops like this can be avoided by:
- Bettering myself
- Getting outside perspective from others
- Allowing things to get worse befre they get better

### Bettering myself
This is pretty self explainatory, and something I probably dont have to dive into the benefits of. 
The better I am at avoiding bad behaviors, the better I will be at identifying them in my child. 

#### Getting outside perspective
Socializing children is great on it's own.
There is an added benefit that I am no longer the sole feedback giver.
If I believe most people are more good than bad (I do), then everyones faults may cancel out!

#### Allowing things to get worse
Lets use the stereotypical example of my child  having emotional outbursts in a stores candy isle.
I try to correct the manner by buying my child a candy bar. 
Well, next time we are in that store my child knows if they cry hard enough they can get a candy bar. 
In this case I should have allowed my child to have the tantrum (temporary pain) to avoid long term effects.

This can go the other way too. 
My child is having emotional outbursts in a stores candy isle.
I say absolutely no candy today.
My child gets even sadder and angrier, to which I respond "and no desert tongith if you keep it up".
My child grows angrier.
I add on even more punishments until my child and I are basically at war with eachother for the day.

Both of these are examples of reacting too quickly to feedback. 
I need to expect some fluctuations, and in some cases a quick response may be worse than waiting a bit to let things calm down. 


# Conclusions

Thinking in advance is important, but not more important than loving every minute I have with my baby. 
In fact, I think love and finding in love in your child is more important than anything I wrote here. 
I work on loving and finding happiness and love in my relationship with my baby every day.

I still thave some big questions on my mind (from above)
- How involved should I be in my childs life?
- What is my role as a parent?
- Am I worrying too much?
- How do I avoid feedback loops?

My thoughs are that I should solidify these questions before worrying about discipline techniques or sleep training. 

Maybe, trying to answer these questions before real-life parenting issues is like trying to figure out your purpose in life before you even think about starting that math homework assignment. 

I have the benefit of time right now, my baby is only 9 mopnths. 
Hopefully by thinking hard about these questions now, I can avoid some feedback loops in the future and dynamically adjust to my childs needs while also staying on the path of a healthy child-parent relationship.
