title: Confusing the variable for the entire equation

Parenting is tough. A lot of people are telling you what the right decision is. Not much of this is data backed, so most of it comes down to parental choices. But how do you make a choice in a void of information?

# This post is in response to something
I think people learn a lot by talking to others. The problem is people are slightly unreliable when asked for reasons they make certain choices.

I have made posts before about this. Decisions are complicated and often involve a large utility calculation. When pushed, the first "reason" someone may give you for a decision is probably not "I made a large calculation with a lot of imputs and a lot of things to consider".

For example, "Why do you work in tech?" may have the response, "I have always loved computers!" In reality the answer is probably closer to "A series of life choices based off the information I had at the time made this job the most desirable to me out of a lot of other options" The response, "I have always loved computers!" isnt the real reason-- I also love birds but I am not a professional bird watched because my career choice is complicated!

I understand why this happens and I think simple explainations have their place. I think if enough people repeat the same thing though, it may get dangerous. What if someone hear me and thinks "I like computers, I should get into tech too". That is dangerous. Not everyone who likes computers should go into tech, just like everyone who likes dogs shouldnt be a dog walker. A career choice should be a complicated one that shouldn't boil down to simply "what do you like"? What you like should still be a factor, but it shouldnt be the only factor, not the whole calculation.

This happens a lot in parenting. Reasons parents give for their parenting choices get inflated into the entire calculation rather than a simple factor. 

# What would I do in the most convenient world
When making parenting decisions for my kid, I try to use the heuristic: " what choice would I make if I had unlimited time and resources?" That choice is almost always unreasonable. The beauty of this heuristic is it then forces me to admit to myself that I am compromising, or at least weighing my needs against my children's. Now-- taking care of yourself *is* taking care of the family and a net gain for everyone involved. It's not selfish to say you are making this calculation. But, I think ignoring the calculation is a bit dishonest.

# Sleep Training
Sleep training is when you, to some degree, allow your child to cry in order for them to sleep well. I honestly feel like if I had unlimited time and resources, I would hold my baby every night until they are old enough to have a discussion and make sure they understand that I am one room away if they need *anything*. Spoiler alert, I still ended up sleep training my baby at 1yo because we could not juggle work/sleep/health with a baby that just couldn't sleep without us. I did my research and I think there _are_ benefits to sleep training, but to me it feels weird to say *I am doing it for the kid* when I just so happen to also get a huge quality of life improvement. I find it more true to say, in a perfect world I would stay up with my baby as they sleep on me... But I don't live in a perfect world and I need to sleep/work/function to take care of the family soooo, sleep training it is! It sounds cold, but I feel like it's more honest than "I am doing my child a favor by sleep training them".

It's important to note, I'm not saying we have to do the _unlimited time and resources_ thing. There still needs to be a calculation. There seems to be atleast 2 big randomized control trials that show after 5 years there is no difference in sleep-trained versus non-sleep-trained children. Lets be honest though the alternative to sleep training is either not sleeping or co-sleeping, both of which have PROVEN negative effects on the parents. On the other hand, sleep training involves a lot of crying and every intuition tells me thats not good. 

The reason I am writing this post and the thing I want to be weary of is people telling you "Sleep training is GOOD for your baby". The RCT proves that there is no effect both ways, so "sleep training is NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD for your baby" would be more accurate. I believe the argument "Sleep training is GOOD for your baby" sometimes comes from parents wanting to justify their choices. I think this because I kind of did that. When your baby is crying franticly and you are sitting on the other side of the door listening, you will tell yourself a lot to justify the decision. I just want to shoot down the idea that "Sleep training is GOOD for your baby". In reality parents are making a utility calculation and sometimes sleep training is the best choice.

# Independent play
When it comes to how independent I want my child to be. I feel like my _unlimited time and resources_ answer would be to allow my children to _feel_ independent while also never letting them leave my sight. Anything less than that does seem like a compromise. The best decision for me and my family may be to let my kids play at the playground by themselves while I do dishes in my house a block away, but that is a compromise from watching them from the car nearby. I think it can be the right decision, but I think it should be framed as me making a compromise/tradeoff calculation instead of "I am giving my child the gift of independence".

I don't want to belittle the importance of fostering independence, or promoting self soothing (In regards to sleep training). But I think they are often used to fully justify a decision when in reality they are a small variable in the balancing act between what is a perfect decision and what is actually feasible. 

# My point
If someone asks me for a reason for something, I give a simple reason. I need to focus on being more cognizant that _these aren't real reasons_. I also need to be more cognizant that reasons other people give me _aren't real reasons_. It is next to impossible to discuss the entire equation, so we focus on our heaviest weighted variables. Depending on the person, they may not even be talking about the heavies weighted variables. This is useful, but it is important not to confuse the *variable for the equation*.
