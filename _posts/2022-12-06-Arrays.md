This is the second post in my python sequences. I will be using the following method of learning:
This is an example of a new way of learning I want to try to implement I will
- Give a problem statement
- Give a complete set of related tools, some that may be used in the solution
- Allow the learner to attempt stringing the tools together for a solution
- Propose a simple solution
- Allow the learner to attempt to revise if needed
- Continue proposing more complex solutions as needed

# Problem Statement
The quicksort method is a way of sorting arrays. If implemented naively, the quicksort can get pretty slow. One method of speeding up the quicksort is take the quicksort's "pivot value" and make sure everything before the pivot value is less than the pivot value and everything greater than the pivot value comes after it in the array. Write a function that takes an array A and a pivot value, i and sorts it in this manner.

# Tools
Here are the tools you may need

## Array Basics
The below method shows a lot of array basics:

```python
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]  # Create array
a = cars[0]  # a = "Ford"
x = len(cars)  # x = 3, length

cars.append("Honda")  # Adds honda as index 3
b = cars.pop(1)  # Removes index 1 and returns it
cars_second = cars.copy()  # Copies the list
count = cars.count("BMW")  # Counts instances
cars.extend(cars_second)  # Adds two arrays
index = cars.index("Ford")  # Returns the index of the term
cars.insert(2, "Kia")  # inserts to the specified index
cars.reverse()  # Reverses the order of the list
cars.sort()  # Sorts the list
cars.clear()  # Clears it
```

## Creating a list
You can "hard code" the list:
```python
myList = [3, 5, 7, 11]
print(myList)
# Prints [3, 5, 7, 11]
```

You can add lists and multiply
```python
myList = [1] + [0]*10
print(myList)
# Prints [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

You can also use the list function along with other functions like range
```python
myList = list(range(10))
print(myList)
# Prints [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## 2D arrays are important?
You should probably know how these work although in my experience they arent used often.
```python
my2Darray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
print(my2Darray)
# Prints [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
## checking for an item in a list
It is worth knowing that _a in Array_ will check if something exists:

```python
myList = [3, 5, 7, 11]
print(5 in myList)
# Prints true
```

## Deep versus shallow copy
Thisn't isnt even copying. It just creates a reference to the original object
```python
myList = [3, 5, 7, 11]
newList = myList
myList[0] = 4
print(myList)  # Prints [4, 5, 7, 11]
print(newList)  # Prints [4, 5, 7, 11]
```

This is a shallow copy, one layer deep is copied. 
```python
myList = [3, 5, 7, 11]
newList = list(myList)
myList[0] = 4
print(myList)  # Prints [4, 5, 7, 11]
print(newList)  # Prints [3, 5, 7, 11]
```

Finally a deep copy example:
```python
import copy

myList = [1, 2, [3, 5], 4]
myListCopy = copy.copy(myList)
myListDeep = copy.deepcopy(myList)
myList[1] = 9
myList[2][0] = 7
print(myList)  # [1, 9, [7, 5], 4]
print(myListCopy)  # [1, 2, [7, 5], 4]
print(myListDeep)  # [1, 2, [3, 5], 4]
```

For these its important to note the python primitive types:
- Integers
- Float
- Strings
- Boolean

Anything other than these is a reference of some type.

## Sorted lists
There are some things that are helpful for sorted lists:
```python
myList = [3, 11, 9, 9, 9, 2]
myList.sort()  # Sorted would return a new one
print(myList)  # Prints [2, 3, 9, 9, 9, 11]
print(min(myList))  # Prints 2
print(max(myList))  # Prints 11

import bisect

print(bisect.bisect(myList, 9))  # returns 5 it is bisect right by default
print(bisect.bisect_left(myList, 9))  # returns 2

myList.reverse()  # reversed would return a new one
print(myList)  # Prints [11, 9, 9, 9, 3, 2]
```

## Slicing
you can slice using myArray[i:j:k] with i, j, and k being optional. 

```python
myList = list(range(10))
print(myList)  # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(myList[0:3])  # Prints [0, 1, 2]
print(myList[3:0:-1])  # Prints [3, 2, 1]
print(myList[1:]+myList[:1])  # Prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
```

## List comprehension
Not going to lie. I hate list comprehension. It has always felt like it makes code shorter but needlessly complicated. But it is quick and easy
```python
#[Result][iterator][expression][logical]
h_letters = [letter for letter in 'human' if True]
print(h_letters)  # ['h', 'u', 'm', 'a', 'n']
number_list = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
print(number_list)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
obj = ["Even" if i%2==0 else "Odd" for i in range(10)]
print(obj)  # ['Even', 'Odd', 'Even', 'Odd', 'Even', 'Odd', 'Even', 'Odd', 'Even', 'Odd']
```

# Simple Solutions
Before reading this section try to come up with a simple solution. Use as much space and time complexity as needed.

## Using multiple arrays
By far the simplest solution would be to make three arrays, small, equal, and larger then combine them:

```python
    def pivotCalc(self, array, index):
        """
        :type: array,int(index of pivot)
        :rtype: A: array
        """
        # there will be three arrays
        smaller_than_pivot = []
        equal_to_pivot = []
        larger_than_pivot = []

        pivot = array[index]

        for number in array:
            if number > pivot:
                larger_than_pivot.append(number)
            if number == pivot:
                equal_to_pivot.append(number)
            if number < pivot:
                smaller_than_pivot.append(number)

        return [*smaller_than_pivot, *equal_to_pivot, *larger_than_pivot]
```

This honestly isn't a bad solution. Time complexity is O(n) but space complexity is O(n) because you need multiple arrays. Honestly, this would be a PERFECT answer for almost all production code, but CS majors take years of classes teaching you alternatives so we must investigate. 

# More complex answers

See if you can improve upon the above solution before reading on

## Using one array
Lets try re-arranging things within the original array so we can keep space complexity low. To do this we will do two passes:
- Pass 1 we will move everything smaller than the pivot value to the left
- Pass 2 we will move everything larger than the pivot to the right
- Everything equal to the pivot will remain in the middle

```python
    def pivotCalc(self, array, index):
        """
        :type: array,int(index of pivot)
        :rtype: A: array
        """
        pivot = array[index]
        smallerPlaced = 0
        largerPlaced = len(array) - 1

        # Move everything smaller than the pivot to the left
        for i in range(len(array)):
            if array[i] < pivot:
                array[i], array[smallerPlaced] = array[smallerPlaced], array[i]
                smallerPlaced += 1
        # Move everything larger on the right
        for i in reversed(range(len(array))):
            if array[i] < pivot:
                break
            if array[i] > pivot:
                array[i], array[largerPlaced] = array[largerPlaced], array[i]
                largerPlaced -= 1
        return array
```
Time complexity is O(2n) because you make two passes but space complexity is O(1) because you need multiple arrays. Thats an improvement!

## One pass
We did it with two passes, can we get it down to one pass?

Like the last example. Don't expect yourself to figure this one out. It will come with time. Basically you have three categories, unclassified, larger and smaller. You step through each unclassified and place them. 

```python
    def pivotCalc(self, array, index):
        """
        :type: array,int(index of pivot)
        :rtype: A: array
        """
        pivot = array[index]
        smallerPlaced = 0
        largerPlaced = len(array)
        i = 0

        while i < largerPlaced:
            if array[i] < pivot:
                array[i], array[smallerPlaced] = array[smallerPlaced], array[i]
                smallerPlaced += 1
                i += 1
            elif array[i] > pivot:
                largerPlaced -= 1
                array[i], array[largerPlaced] = array[largerPlaced], array[i]
            else:  # Equals pivot
                i += 1
        return array
```
This is O(n) time and O(1) space yayy!

# conclusion
Yet again, there is a simple solution and varying degrees of complicated solutions. We were able to reduce space complexity by performing everything in place. We were able to reduce time complexity by dwindling down how many passes are needed.

These solutions will scale over most array based questions.
