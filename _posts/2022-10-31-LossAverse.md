Loss aversion is under attack. Turns out winning a nobel prize puts a target on your back and khaneman is having loss aversion questioned. I am after his Nobel prize, so here is my attack.

# what is loss aversion 

Imagine you won 5\\$ yayy! You feel happy. Now imagine you lost 5\\$ , boo! You feel sad. Loss aversion claims that you feel almost twice as sad loosing the 5\\$ than you feel happy winning the 5\\$. 
This is used, for instance in free trials. The hope is that if you are considering buying a product, you are weighing how happy you would be if you got the product. But, if I give it to you for free now when the trial is up you need to decide how sad you will be without it. So this should work in favor of companies.
This is different than risk aversion because it happens regardless of probability. 

# let's change one thing

My issue with loss aversion is that economists always like to do experiments with set dollar values and therefore define their terms in absolute utility cost.
See above the definition is comparing 5\\$ with 5\\$ . 
I see the reason we need to run studies this way. 
I do not think this is the way people think though. I think 5\\$ to a homeless man is wayy different than 5\\$ to mr. Moneybags. I think in a LOT of cases people think of money as compared to their wealth. 5\\$ to a homeless man may be 20% of his daily income and 5\\$ to a billionaire is 0.0001%. I am sure the homeless man will fight for the 5\\$ more than Mr. Moneybags. 
I think because we think in percentages, the definition should be converted to percentages. I think it should state that someone fears a 5% loss 2 times more than they want a 5% gain. The 5% number is arbitrary in the same way the 5\\$ in the original definition was arbitrary.

So, I am changing the definition from 5\\$ to 5%. This doesn't change the claim in any way.

One last way to think of this change is if the person had 100\\$ in their wallet. The claim is that they would be twice as sad to find 95\\$ in their pocket as they would be happy to find 105\\$. I am changing it to... They would be twice as sad to incur a 5% loss (bringing them to 95\\$) as they would be happy to gain 5% (105\\$). Here it is obvious they are the same statement.

Importantly, I make this change in terminology because i believe that is how people actually think of money. I don't believe that a homeless man and Mr. Moneybags see 5\\$ as the same utility. I think people view money as a percent gain. That is why some people deposit cans while others don't. A 5\\$ increase means something different to people based off how much money they have. Therefore to compare 5\\$ to 5\\$ you are entirely missing the bigger picture which is that people see these as 5% gains and 5% losses.

# but a 5% loss is ACTUALLY worse than a 5% gain
 
In other situations a 5% loss actually is worse than a 5% gain. Let me prove it. 

You have 100 dollars, you gain 5% then you lose 5%. That means you bank account goes 100, 105, 99.75. The order of things isn't the problem either. You have 100 dollars, you lose 5% then you gain 5%. That means you bank account goes 100, 95, 99.75. So a 5% loss is Worse than a 5% gain, when comparing the two. 

If you put 100\\$ in the bank and gain 1\\% one day, lose 1\\% the next, gain 1%, lose 1%, for a year. You will have about 99\\$ . It gets much more dramatic if you raise the percents. If you put 100\\$ in the bank and gain 50% one day, lose 50% the next, gain 50%, lose 50%, you will have 1\\$ in your account after a month.

Here is a fun chart.

In order to make up for a 50% loss, a 100% gain is needed. If you lose half your money, you now need to double your current money to make it up!

Losses seem to be worse than gains in this way. 

# Loss Aversion is looking pretty rational

Through our new lense of losses being worse than gains, It seems pretty rational for people to want to avoid losses. 

In fact I think people kind of intuitively know this. For someone with 100\\$ in their bank account, making another 100\\$ is probably harder than it would be for someone with 1,000,000% in their bank accounbt to make 100\\$. We kind of intuitively know that a setback takes a lot of work to recover from.

If you agree with this you may see why I believe that loss aversion may actually be rational. 

# I am using percents wrong 
I am aware that I am using percentages wrong. A 5\\$ loss and a 5\\$ gain is equal. Also giving someone 5\\$ then taking away 5\\$, then end up right where they began. The reason I could prove that a loss is worse than a gain in percentages was because I could re-frame the losses and gains in terms of a persons overall wealth. Some would call this an error. I argue that it is more in line with the way people think and reason, so I would argue that switching to dollars instead of percentages is the error. 

# Extreme cases

I think I can back up my claims of rationality when we push this to the extreme. I currently have X dollars in my bank account. Gaining X would be great but not life-changing. Losing X would be horrifying and have many consequences.*

Ignoring the horrifying consequences makes the utility function calculable but in reality they need to be considered.

*_There is a word for this, I forget it_.

# My new theory is explaining too much

I am now in a spot where I could rationalize ANY loss aversion. That's a sign of a bad idea. Lets reign it in. 

I think a perfectly rational person considers gains and losses as a percent of their total money. I think that a perfectly rational person would consider a 10% loss equivilent to a 11% gain. I think a perfectly rational person would consider a 50% loss equivilent to a 100% gain. Saying losses are feared 2X as much as gains is a vast oversimplification that breaks down for poeple with less money and for large sums of money.

# Im not really arguing with anyone

The start of this article where I said I would be attacking Khaneman was a lie. They already know all this. This stuff is in economic textbooks, textbooks that the authors partially wrote. I am not bringing anything new to the table here that Khanaman and Tverski (the originators of the term) didnt already know. 

In fact, I wanted to cite a source that supports the idea that people "think in percentages". Its called reference dependence and it thoroughly written about and discussed in Khaneman's works.

So, I am not disagreeing, but I am raising my hand with a question. I am curious why this is defined as a cognative bias although it seems perfectly rational to be fearful of losses.

To attempt the idealogical turing test I think a response to this would be.

This is a cute theory but us scientists cannot just blog ideas we must back up our findings with data and the current theory you are attacking is backed by data. 

Also, our finding can be considered a standard deviation with the average person in the middle. By pointing out that our theory falls apart at extremes is just pointing out that our normal distribution has tails. Duh.

What do you think? I just added comments to my blog.

### I already regret this post
When I was in 5th grade I wrote a letter to Einstein talking about how I though he was missing a term in E=MC2. At the time I figured if you are going to turn energy into mass you needed something to hold the new mass, and his equation has no term for a bucket or syringe, so he needs a container constant. I actually thought I was contributing to science and that my parents would send it to him and I would be famous for finding something out. 

This post kind of reads like that doesnt it. I do NOT have above a high school understanding of economics, nor am I well read in behavioral economics. Yet these topics interest me and occasionally I want to geek out about this stuff in a similar way to how I want to geek out about star wars or Elden Ring theories. I am using this blog to rant and organize my thoughts. I find it fun to organize my thoughts and make arguments, but I honestly dont believe they deserve to be taken any more serious as 5th grade Ed writing to Einstein. I could write about things I am a domain expert in, but thats not what I want to geek out about right now. How do I grapple with this?
