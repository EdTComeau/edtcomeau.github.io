title: Book Review- CHANGE is the only constant
---

"Change is the only constant" is the second book I read by Ben Orlin, after "Math with Bad Drawings".
I consider this book in the same category as "What-If" and other books by xkcd comic writer Randall Munroe.
I consider all of these books a guilty pleasure.

I feel guilty in the same way I do when I watch a youtube video that distills an extremely complex topic and makes it so the average person can kind of understand what is going on.
I need to be careful not to mistake my abstract understanding for ACTUAL understanding. 
For example: Orlin explains space-time-dilation so well in one chapter I might actually feel like I know a bit about relativity.

I feel like this book is either:
- A fun way to get people excited about certain math topics
- A way to make you feel smarter
The fact that I never really dive into these topics after the book, makes me worry that I fall into the latter category. 
I will ground myself after the book by looking at some [project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) math problems to put me in my place. 
I will read all of Orlin's books and I will suggest them to everyone, but I can't shake this feeling like I am an [imposter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) for it.

# In lieu of review
This is a funny and entertaining book. 
I really dont want to summarize it because that would be so much work, instead I will attempt to copy Orlin's tone and add a chapter as a later blog post.
