title: The explosive child

In 1993 Doctor Ross Greene "created a treatment approach for collaboratively resolving problems between children with social, emotional and behavioral challenges and their caregivers." At this time he ran a private therapy practice as well as working part time for Mass General Hospital. He practiced his collaborative approach at both jobs. This approach will later be called the Collaborative Problem Solving approach, or CPS.

In 1998 he wrote a book on it, "The Explosive Child: A New Approach for Understanding and Parenting Easily Frustrated Chronically Inflexible Children". 

That's the book I will be reviewing, but a quick history before we dive into the book...

In 1998 Greene also befriended Ablon, a post-doctoral fellow at MGH who later rented space from Greene for his practice. They worked closely together and founded the Collaborative Problem Solving Institute as a part of MGH's Department of Psychiatry.

In 2002 they wrote a book together called "Treating Explosive Kids: The Collaborative Problem Solving Approach". Greene later claims Ablon didn't contribute much to the book.

MGH started Think Kids "an initiative of the nonprofit Collaborative Problem Solving Institute in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital." In 2008 Ablon began working full-time as the director of MGHâ€™s Think:Kids program. In 2009 Greene's employment was terminated.

In 2012 Ross Greene sued Ablon. Greene alleged copyright infringement, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, tortious interference, conversion, unfair competition, and trademark infringement.  He sought dissolution of a corporation, the Center for Collaborative Problem Solving, jointly owned and directed by Greene and Ablon.  MGH counterclaimed for trademark infringement, false advertising, and unfair competition.

This is a (completely made up) courtroom drama of the ruling:
INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The courtroom pulses with anticipation as the judge prepares to deliver the verdict in Greene v. Ablon. Ross Greene, a determined doctor, stands firm as the plaintiff, while J. Stuart Ablon and representatives from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) anxiously await their fate.

LAWYER 1 (representing Greene)
(Passionately)
Your Honor, Dr. Greene's brilliant mind birthed the Collaborative Problem Solving Approach. He deserves justice for his stolen intellectual property!

LAWYER 2 (representing Ablon and MGH)
(Defiantly)
Objection, Your Honor! Dr. Ablon's contributions were vital. This is a shared creation, and both parties must be acknowledged!

The judge's gaze sharpens as they prepare to make a life-altering decision.

JUDGE
(Dramatically)
Dr. Greene, can you prove your claim of sole authorship and copyright infringement?

GREENE
(Determined)
Your Honor, I hold the copyrights for my creations. The defendant's involvement was minor at best.

A tense silence fills the courtroom as the judge contemplates the evidence.

JUDGE
(With thunderous conviction)
The Collaborative Problem Solving Approach shall be recognized as a joint creation! However, the issue of copyright infringement will not be dismissed.

The courtroom erupts in gasps and murmurs. Dr. Greene and Dr. Ablon lock eyes, realizing that their battle has only just begun.

FADE OUT.

I think there were other court cases. This dragged on for a bit, but it resulted in Greene pivoting and calling his approach Collaborative & Proactive Solutions, still CPS.

# the parenting landscape

For the time, Greene's model for care was unique. In my last post I laid out a history of parenting. During the time of this book average parents were involved in their children with high expectations but it was still not certain how much warmth a parent should show their child. There was a heavy focus on discipline forming acceptable behaviors. As we will see, Greene's ideas involve relaxing the discipline to encourage growth. This was a fairly new idea that resonated with parents, especially of parents struggling with tantrums.

I decided to give the original book a read:

# get to the book review
## Chapter 1: The Waffle Episode

This book is designed for a very specific type of child. The explosive child. What does an explosive child look like? They look like a perfectly normal child, what a silly question. What does an explosive child's behavior look like? That's a better question.

Explosive children have cognitive skills at a normal pace but struggle with inflexibility and frustration tolerance. Basically they are unable to cope with even small changes and are thrown into absolutely inconsolable fits when expectations are shattered.

Part of me wants to leaving you trying to figure out why this chapter is titled waffles. Take a guess. Now see if your right:

Sally is a 7 year old who woke up one morning, opened a box of frozen waffles. She saw four frozen waffles, said great I can have two today and two tomorrow. While she is eating her waffles her brother comes down and takes the last two waffles out of the box. Sally says "those are my waffles for tomorrow!" Sally's mom intervenes, Sally becomes irate and is no longer able to be reasoned with. She is on the floor crying, refusing to leave the house and shouting horrible things at her mom and brother.

To Sally's mom it seems as though this came out of nowhere. It may seem like one needs to walk on eggshells with Sally to avoid an 'explosion' ruining everyone's morning. Conventional advice (at the time of writing this book) may be that Sally needs more discipline. Greene is going to walk us through his alternative approach, which involves understanding these outbursts and the child. 

## Children Do Well If They Can
This chapter is about shifting perspectives. Explosive children are not bad children, they are lagging behind in some essential skills.

If a child is lagging behind in math we don't say, "don't you dare do math the wrong way, do math better right now or go to your room". We try to provide resources and help to get the child caught up. Same thing for explosive children, we need to teach them skills not scold. 

It also helps to understand that these children aren't acting out for attention or doing this because they have no respect. Greene urges parents to recognize that their child is good between tantrums, they are good children that need help not discipline. 

Greene also talks about medical conditions here as well like ADHD and OCD. He mentions that some of the explosive children he helps do have diagnosable conditions. Medication is no fun, but may be a useful tool here. 

## Pathways and Triggers

I like Greene's analogy of Vapor lock. A car engine has a tube with liquid gasoline that flows to it. If the engine overheats, the liquid gasoline in the tube can turn to a gas, which doesn't travel through the tube like liquid. Because of this the engine gets no gasoline and can't run until it cools down. 

In the same way, a child can get so frustrated that reasoning is impossible. No point in trying to figure out causes of potential fixes, we are in vapor lock. We just need to wait until the child cools down.

With this in mind, it is important to prevent these tantrums before vapor lock. Prevention is key here. Is Sally constantly getting upset with waffles? Maybe getting an extra few boxes at the store can prevent issues. 

We will get into this later, but it is important to "pick your battles" here. If Sally gets irate whenever dad picks her up from school, prevention may look like re-arranging everyone's schedule so mom can pick-up. This may feel like "giving in" but it is hopefully temporary and might make your life a lot easier.

## The Truth About Consequences
Rewards and punishments are commonly used to alter behavior. It is important to recognize that the reason this tantrum is happening is because the child is behind in a skill needed to cope with change. Reward and punishment can't teach the child this skill. 

Greene suggests to parents that if reward and punishment worked, they wouldn't be having this problem. Consequences are usually parents first line of defense, so why keep trying?! Time to try something different. 

## Collaborative and Proactive Solutions (CPS)
Greene suggests imagining three baskets to put conflicts with a child in.

Basket A contains conflicts that are a safety concern. If a child is putting themself or others at risk of harm, it's basket A. Basket A items are not negotiable and must be acted upon.

I'm going to skip over basket B for a moment.

Basket C are conflicts that we choose are not worth getting involved in. Basket C behaviors are just allowed to happen. An example may be if a child refuses to change out of PJs before leaving the house, you might just let them go out in PJs. 

Basket B are the behaviors that we choose to intervene in. These behaviors are important to the parents and we believe we can productively teach conflict resolution for them. Basket B can be small at first, we want to attempt to teach the child how to explain themself and express their feelings before they get overwhelmed. Basket B is where the learning happens.

Basket B can be dealt with by empathizing, making a plan, and inviting the child to the plan. This can be give and take and the plan is more of a negotiation. The child will be learning how to deal with conflict from YOUR behavior, so it is important to be flexible.

Each basket has a different purpose. A is for teaching children that parents are the authoritative figures. B is to help children learn how to deal with conflict. C is for recognizing your child's limitations.

## Chapter 7: Learning Curves
There are a lot of pitfalls one can fall into. 

Often basket C needs more behaviors than parents expect. It's important to recognize a child's limitations. Their limitations may be different from other children's. Accepting this is hard, but needed.

If your child is exploding a lot you may be filling basket A more than you need. If there are truly too many safety concerns you might need to manage your expectations and preemptively creat a low risk environment.

Your child might agree to a negotiation and not follow through. This is a hint that you might have been expecting too much.

## Teach Your Child Well
Teaching happens in basket B.

The child needs to be able to:
- articulate his concerns
- consider possible solutions and
- be able to reflect on the feasibility and likely outcomes of solutions and the degree to which they are mutually satisfactory.

This chapter explores the skills required for a child to participate in Plan B successfully. It focuses on teaching skills related to language processing, executive functioning, emotional regulation, cognitive flexibility, and social skills. It also addresses the importance of training these skills alongside Plan B.


## the rest of the book
There are four other chapters more specifically outlining what family dynamics play out, what this looks like in a classroom, and medication. I think what I have got so far outlined a very basic understanding of the idea. 

It is a short book so I am not going to try to condense everything into this post. If you have an explosive child or these ideas resonate I suggest reading the book. 

## conclusion
For the time, this book was really important. This book helped push parents into the direction we are today. If you find yourself saying "well duh I knew that" to some of these ideas, the reason you "know that" may very well because this book is the foundation of many tantrum and emotion emotional management schools of thought today.

Today it is still important! I bet you've never heard this before but kids grow up so fast! They immediately start acting and talking so adult like. It can be jarring when your kid throws these emotional tantrums and you don't know what to do. This book served me as a friendly reminder that our kids are not emotionally developed. It's easy to forget that they are a work in progress. You wouldn't take bread out of the oven half way through cooking and complain it doesn't look right. You can't take a developing childs mind and expect them to reason and express emotion like an adult. I think it is easy to think that a kid is being unreasonable and get frustrated but unreasonable should be the expectation! Kids are learning how to reason and deal with emotions. Treating these big feelings as teaching moments and times to support your child and go along for the ride rather than fight them is an idea that resonated with me.
