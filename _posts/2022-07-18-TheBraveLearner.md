title: Book Review- The Brave Learner
---

Every now and then I am reminded of how bad the US school systems can be for a child.
Sometimes a problem seems so gigantic that I daydream of sidestepping the problem completely.
Homeschooling would be the side-step solution here, but even thinking that out loud comes with a lot of internal judgement. 
I decided to read Julie Bogart's book, "The Brave Learner" because I have been told it paints a beautiful picture of best case scenario home-schooling and I should give this idea it's best shot. 

# Summary
As always, this whole section will be my attempt to summarize the authors views while keeping my opinions to myself. 

## PART 1 Enchanted Learning
This part of the book is applicable to homeschoolers or not.
These tips are meant for any parent who wants to foster a love of learning in their children. 
### Enchanted living space
Keep the living space fun.
Have activity corners that are always open for the child to craft and play.
Create an environment that is fun and inviting to learn
### Keep the sparks going
If a child shows interest in something, go with it.
Something may not seem fun to you, or even educational, but if your child is interested you should nurture that. 
Even things like video games, with a push in the right direction, can be an educational experience. 
### Techniques for learning
- Anything can be taught through anything
If your child is into dinosaurs, have them learn art by drawing dinosaurs, history by dino-books, science by Dino-killing volcano dioramas etc.
- Children already love learning
Your child wants to learn but is used to having their interests poo-pooed away as unimportant or educational. 
If you encourage your child’s interests, they will naturally learn.  

## Part 2 Casting the spell
This is the meat and potatoes of the book, which I will ironically give the least amount of detail. 
I feel like with these bullets you can see what the author is getting at, but if you want more details, you should really read the book, it is a short easy read. 
These are solid ideas for teaching anything, regardless of whether you r children are homeschooled or not.
### the four forces of enchantment
Four ways to make learning something more fun!
- Surprise
- Mystery
- Risk
- Adventure
### The four capacities for learning
How to get your child involved more!
- Curiosity
- Collaboration
- Contemplation
- Celebration
### The four ports of entry
Four ways to get your child to learn material!
- Mind
- Body
- Heart
- Spirit

This, unlike the other sections in part 2 may need a description.
Teach using a lot of different methods, have the child act it out or move a lot, or apply emotions to your teaching.

## Part 3 Sustaining the Magic
This section is geared more towards homeschoolers.
### To Schedule or not to schedule
Routine is better than a schedule. 
No need to plan everything, but having a routine is key.
### Chores
You can't educate and also clean all day. 
If you have a messy house, it isn’t conducive to learning and therefore the children need to be involved in cleaning. 
### Embracing our limitations
You are one human, taking on something you haven't been formally trained in (probably). 
You must go at your child’s pace, if they are slow at reading, they can take time to read.
If they are slow at everything, they can wait to go to college if that’s what they choose. 
Every year will be different as you learn.

## Part 4 Keeping it going
This section is exclusively for homeschoolers, but I am not homeschooling a child right now and I found my favorite nuggets of wisdom in this section. 
### Family dysfunction to sideline learning
By Homeschooling, you are mixing your family life with your school life. 
Parenting issues become schooling issues, and this can become quite the weight to bear.
Stay truthful to your children and address these issues and things will work out. 
### The dangers of ideological Alignment and true belief-ism
It is tempting to stick to an ideology and get angry if you stray from that ideology. 
Instead, remember the principals that made you like that ideology and stick to those principles instead. 

# My opinions
I love Julie's love for learning. 
I summarize books like these because I like the tips they give, and I believe I will actually look back at this summary later in life. 
I think the ideas for learning here are all great tools that should be taken seriously from a seriously experienced educator.

## Are these great tools building a home or a prison
Remember what I said in the last sentence because that is the most important thing here...
This book has a great set of tools. 
But this book is also pushing homeschooling a lot!
At no point the author says homeschooling is right for everyone, but they do spend half the book talking about homeschooling techniques. 

So, then the question is, is homeschooling the right thing for me?

## What does the research say
So, I go to the research. I found a [meta analysis](https://www.othereducation.org/index.php/OE/article/download/259/261) that I like. 
It points out that there is not a lot of good research on homeschooling. 
Often the current literature relies on self-reporting and homeschooling families often choose to only report to those that are promoting homeschooling. 
There are more observational studies that point to better outcomes for homeschooled students. 
It is important to keep in mind this correlation does not imply causation. 
Homeschooling requires one non-working parent which is a privilege that not all families have. 
So, these "better outcomes" are probably also have high earning (and maybe highly educated) parents to begin with.

## What do I say (in response to the research)
My take on it is that if you are careful about socializing your child and you think homeschooling would bring you happiness, there isn't enough data to persuade you away from it. 

Honestly, I wouldn't weigh "ruining your child’s future education" anywhere in the list of reasons not to homeschool.

Reasons to homeschool
- You can afford it
- Homeschooling sounds exciting to you
- Homeschooling works for your child
- You have time to spare

Reasons NOT to homeschool
- A lot of added responsibilities as parent
- A lot of added stress
- Might not be right for every child
- You really need to socialize your child more

There was one study that found that parents "Heavily involved" in their children’s education end up better off than their homeschooled counterparts. 
This may be the alternative here. 
But I must worry that "heavily involved" may encompass all the parents that put too much pressure on their children. 

## If I did homeschool, would I follow this book exactly?
All these ideas sound like healthy ways to approach teaching a child.
This book doesn't talk too much about a curriculum or standardized tests. 

I know part of homeschooling is to avoid these standardized tests, but the problem is I would want to know how I am doing as a teacher. 
I am sure this is a solved problem in the Homeschooling community, there are probably curriculum and tests that can be used to see where you are at short of waiting for the college admissions tests. 
Julie doesn't talk about these much, but I would want to use them to at least make sure I was on pace and not missing anything. 
Even though tests come with their stressors, you only get one chance at your child’s education, so no feedback on where you stand could be a huge mistake that is worth some stress. 


### Should I read this book
If you have a kid and are excited about their education yes!

All of the education stuff aside, the section on ideological alignment was a great read as a parent.
So many parenting groups decided they have the "correct way" to do things and this chapter addresses that. 
I like Julie's approach to avoid defending ideological ideals and instead defend the ideals that lead you to like that ideology. 

This is a fun read and so far, the best book I have found about educating my child at home, so I suggest it to anyone who finds that exciting!
